Shared Preferences

Shared Preferences is the way in which one can store and retrieve small amounts of primitive data as key/value pairs to a file on the device storage such as String, int, float, Boolean that make up your preferences in an XML file inside the app on the device storage

Shared Preferences can be thought of as a dictionary or a key/value pair 

For example, you might have a key being “username” and for the value, you might store the user’s username

And then you could retrieve that by its key (here username)

You can have a simple shared preference API that you can use to store preferences and pull them back as and when needed

The shared Preferences class provides APIs for reading, writing, and managing this data
